# BlazorDataStreams

This is the latest entry in my Learning Journey. and it is not expected to be useful to the world at large. However, my LinkedIn posts discuss some speed bumps that I encountered that might be interesting for others just learning about Blazor v8.

For my first Blazor project, I wanted to learn about how components can run on both the client and the server within the same application, which is a new feature of v8. I went even further, with components runnnng on both client and server while being hosted on the same page.

To do this, I adapted my DataStreams project to Blazor. I had an idea of how the components would compare, but I was completely wrong. See my [LI post Part A](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7182478564984803328/) to learn why.

As with the other Learning Journey repos, this project is running on Azure; contact me via LinkedIn for more info.
